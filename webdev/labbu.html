    <hr color ="green" size = "3">
    <p1 style = "font-size: 26px" style = " background-color : blue">Hii atul here , "Akhil ka jigri yaar" . Today I am going to discuss a topic of my bestfriend or you can say i am questioning to uh about him - Is he really a bestfriend material or brother type  for girls ?  </p1>
    <hr>
    <p2 style = "font-size: 26px" style = " background-color : rgb(95, 95, 125)"> Actually what i mean to say  that I(Atul) am with him from last 16 years nd what i am able to point out of him that he have a  crush on some girls . If I  will talk about her first crush "Palak mahajan( _palak.mahajan_)" then all i can say that he loved her alot but in the end what happened with him he came very close to palak but still can't able to confess his feelings nd he lost her but  how?? coss Danish proposed her nd they came in relationship nd then its the first timee when akhil broke down </p1>
        <hr>  

        <p3 style = "font-size: 26px" style = " background-color : rgb(63, 63, 88)">nd now am going to tell uh  about his 2nd crush who is  "mehak sharma"  .Mehak is a first girl who really made him crying and all that (jo b saste aashiq krte hai) . But this girl took his career along with him . akhil is first boii who got  excellent path for grab his goals . He was in akash institute  in 11 th nd was preparing for mains nd Advance nd then suddenly covid came then he came home after that but the worst thing he done in that phase is that he took his admission in mansar hr sec. school but uh know why ?? just for Mehak . He cancelled his jee course nd started studying his 12 th from school nd its that time he completely  lost in that girl . Actually they both r very close to each other its not all his mistake . nd later on he came to know that  she have  a boyfriend  . Then what he started crying nd his board exams also very close so he fucked up completely </p3>
        <hr>
        <p4 style = "font-size: 26px" style = " background-color : rgb(63, 63, 88)">I am not saying that his failure in that perticular area is her mistake i m just saying it is also a one of the factor</p4>
        <hr>
        <p5 style = "font-size: 26px" style = " background-color : rgb(63, 63, 88)">nd now the 3rd one which is currently going on is "sakshi badyal" one of his closest friend i m not judging anything  but i want to keep my pov on it whatever is happening now he will regret in future i m 100 nd 1 % sure </p5>
